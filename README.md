- 👋 Hi, I’m Chukwubuikem. In english, this means "God is my strength". When you add my surname, the full translation becomes "I remember that God is my strenght". Really nice name huh? Yeah!
- 👀 I’m interested in software development as its obviously the new "gold" in the global economy. Everyone and everything is fast relying on technology. I can't be left behind.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in front-end, after which I hope to freelance while preparing to land my first job, hopefully.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something interesting in the near future.
